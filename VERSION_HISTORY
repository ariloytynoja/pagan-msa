v.0.56
By mistake, outputted pruned files for every alignment. This now fixed.


v.0.55
Re-writing the program homepage. Compatible with that. Several changes in
placement heuristics and tree extension


v.0.54
- cleaning up: many unused options removed
- xml output with nhx tags
- changed search order of external tools
- now using BppAncestors for ancestor reconstruction


v.0.53
- TID tags now considered also for ORFs
- fixing the double naming of ORFs
- changed a bad default value for branch-skip-probability (not fixing the bug yet!)


v.0.52
- consistent naming of nucleotide and protein output of ORF alignments
- improvements for alignment pruning
- option to trim extended alignment


v.0.51
- functions for alignment pruning (to reduce large datasets)
- anchoring coverage threshold for skipping the DP alignment altogether
- find-best-orf and compare-reverse with placement

v.0.50
- improvements for pileup of 454 data
- removing gaps from query sequences


v.0.49
Still in development:
 - new option to create a distance tree using bpp_dist package.
 - significant changes (and improvements) for pileup alignment of 454 reads.


v.0.48
- new option: --test-every-terminal-node


v.0.47
- compiles on Darwin and Cygwin


v.0.46
- first integration of MAFFT and RAxML


v.0.45
- reorganised code and fixed recently created bugs


v.0.44
- alignment anchoring with Exonerate or substring matching


v.0.43
- corrected multi-threading for standard multiple alignment


v.0.42
- first attempt for multi-threading for standard multiple alignment


v.0.41
- minor change in how the sequence name is read: no space in the end of line


v.0.40
- reverting earlier changes: now alignment model is again recomputed for each alignment


v.0.39
- selenocysteins are now converted to X
- fixed bugs in the tree parser and use of branch lengths


v.0.38
- minor fixes on program options
- documentation updated


v.0.37
- changes in phylogenetic placement using Exonerate: can run all at one go
- renaming some command line arguments. Please check 'pagan --help'


v.0.36
- fixed the Makefile and issues giving compilation warnings


v.0.35
- new output system: less noise; allows outputting to a file
- translated read alignment with ORF search
- experiments with optimal reference search for read alignment without a reference


v.0.34
- can test also reverse-complement and keep better (for read alignment)
- can do multiple rounds of read placement to find overlap


v.0.33
- query sequence matching equally well to several targets is placed to multiple locations
- alternative scores for choosing the target: default self-normalised substitution score
- the source code now at http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/


v.0.32
- option '--454' works also with FASTA-formatted sequences


v.0.31
- option for contig build to show ancestral sequence across gaps
- option to use more appropriate default settings for PacBio pileup


v.0.30
- separation of consensus ancestor reconstruction and contig assembly
- corrected read order in consensus alignment


v.0.29
- preliminary support for contig assembly
- consensus ancestors for (DNA) read alignment


v.0.28
- preliminary support for read pileup using consensus ancestors


v.0.27
- integrated Exonerate to speed up the search for placement nodes


v.0.26
- repaired the broken ancestor reconstruction: now also for codon data.


v.0.25
- bug fix: reads can now also be aligned against tagged leaf nodes.
- added option to search optimal placement among internal only or all nodes.


v.0.24
- added option '--version' to check for updates.


v.0.23
- this is the first version with the complete set of features described in the manuscript.

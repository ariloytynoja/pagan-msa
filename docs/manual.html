PAGAN is based on the phylogeny-aware progressive alignment algorithm and uses graphs to describe the uncertainty in the presence of characters at certain sequence positions. However, graphs also allow describing the uncertainty in input sequences and modelling e.g. homopolymer errors in Roche 454 reads, or representing inferred ancestral sequences against which other sequences can then be aligned. </p><p>The development of PAGAN started in <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman/" rel="nofollow">Nick Goldman&#x27;s group</a> at the EMBL-European Bioinfomatics Institute, UK, and continues now in <a href="http://blogs.helsinki.fi/sa-at-bi" rel="nofollow">Ari LÃ¶ytynoja&#x27;s group</a> at the Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Finland. PAGAN is still under development and will hopefully evolve to an easy-to-use, general-purpose method for phylogenetic sequence alignment.  </p><p>As the graph representation has features that make PAGAN especially powerful for phylogenetic placement of sequences into existing alignments, the functionality necessary for that has been implemented first. The method and its uses for alignment extension are described in this <a href="preprint/loytynoja.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> and its <a href="preprint/loytynoja_suppl.pdf" rel="nofollow">supplementary material</a>.  </p><hr/><p><br> </p><ul><li><strong><a href="#Installation_of_PAGAN" rel="nofollow">Installing PAGAN</a></strong> </li></ul><blockquote>Instructions to install and start using PAGAN on different operating systems.

The configuration file does not need to be created from scratch as PAGAN can output the options specified for an analysis in a file.

It can compute a guide tree using external programs (MAFFT and RAxML) but also allows the user to provide a <strong>rooted</strong> binary tree relating the sequences. The leaf names in the tree and the sequence names (until the first space) in the sequence file have to match exactly. Alignment is only performed for the parts of the guide phylogeny that have sequences associated; the unnecessary branches and sequences are pruned/dropped out.  </p><p>If MAFFT and RAxML are available on the system (and can be called with commands <tt>mafft</tt> and <tt>raxml</tt>), the minimal command to perform the alignment is: </p><pre class="prettyprint">./pagan --seqfile sequence_file </pre><p>Using a user-specified tree, the minimal command to perform the alignment is: </p><pre class="prettyprint">./pagan --seqfile sequence_file --treefile tree_file </pre><p>The resulting alignment will be written in file <tt>outfile.fas</tt>.

With option <tt>--xml</tt>, PAGAN writes an additional file, containing both the alignment and the guide phylogeny, in the XML-based <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/hsaml" rel="nofollow">HSAML format</a>.  </p><p>PAGAN writes several temporary files to communicate with the helper tools.

The type of data is detected automatically and either DNA or protein model is used. With option <tt>--codons</tt>, PAGAN can align protein-coding DNA sequences using the codon substitution model. Alternatively, with option <tt>--translate</tt>, PAGAN translates the DNA sequences to proteins, aligns them as proteins and writes the resulting alignment as proteins and back-translated DNA. Codon and translated alignment are performed in the first reading frame and no frame correction is performed.     </p><h2><a name="An_example_analysis_with_PAGAN"></a>An example analysis with PAGAN<a href="#An_example_analysis_with_PAGAN" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>As an example of combining several options, the following command: </p><pre class="prettyprint">./pagan --seqfile cDNA_unaligned.fas --outfile cDNA_aligned  --outformat paml --use-anchors \

However, most of these ignore the phylogenetic relationships among the data and simply place the new sequences in the bottom of the alignment. The idea of phylogenetic placement is to extend existing alignments by aligning the new sequences to their true evolutionary positions in the reference alignment. This ensures that the new sequences are compared to the closest possible reference sequence and the alignment created, including the gaps opened for insertions and deletions, is as accurate as possible. </p><p>PAGAN can reconstruct ancestral sequence history for a reference alignment related by a phylogeny. Sequences can then be added to this reference alignment by aligning the new sequences against terminal (extant reference sequences) or internal nodes (reconstructed ancestral sequences) and making room for the added sequences in their correct evolutionary positions among the reference sequences; the addition of new sequences does not affect the relative alignment of original sequences. </p><p>The current version of PAGAN is primarily aimed for guided placement of sequences, i.e. addition of sequences for which the (rough) phylogenetic location is known. The program includes support for unguided placement and can exhaustively search for the best nodes to place the new sequences. However, the latter is still experimental and, if target nodes for guided placement are not specified and exhaustive search is not selected, PAGAN will by default add the sequences at the root of the phylogeny.  </p><p>Originally the target application for the phylogenetic placement was in the analysis of short NGS reads but the same principles also work for full-length DNA sequences and for amino-acid sequences.  </p><p>The minimal command to perform the sequence placement is: </p><pre class="prettyprint">./pagan --ref-seqfile ref_alignment_file --ref-treefile ref_tree_file --queryfile query_sequence_file</pre><p>The reference alignment has to be in FASTA format and the reference tree in Newick or Newick eXtended (NHX) format; the query sequences that will be added in the reference alignment can be either in FASTA or FASTQ format. If the reference alignment consists of one sequence only, the reference guide tree is not required. Again, you can define your own output file with option <tt>--outfile</tt>.   </p><p><br> </p><h2><a name="Assignment_of_queries_to_specific_nodes"></a>Assignment of queries to specific nodes<a href="#Assignment_of_queries_to_specific_nodes" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>If the phylogenetic position of the sequences to be added is known (e.g. the species in question is an outgroup for the clade X), this information can be provided for the placement. Furthermore, one can name multiple alternative positions for the sequences (because the precise position is not known or the reference contains paralogous genes and the copies which the sequences come from are not known) and PAGAN will choose the one where the sequences matches the best. Sequences are assigned to a specific node or a set of nodes using the NHX tree format with an additional tag <tt>TID</tt>. The tag identifier can be any string, in the example below we use number <tt>001</tt>. One can use any number/combination of tags as long as each node and each sequence has at most one tag. </p><p>As an example, let&#x27;s assume  </p><p>a reference alignment: </p><pre class="prettyprint">&gt;A

To facilitate the preparation and visualisation of the reference phylogenies, we have modified Archaeopteryx, the superb phylogeny visualisation program by Christian M Zmasek, to understand the PAGAN-specific tags and allow for their editing. The original Archaeopteryx program and documentation for its use can be found at <a href="http://phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/" rel="nofollow">http://phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/</a>. </p><p>The Archaeopteryx-PAGAN-Edition (here abbreviated as ArchaeopteryxPE) has one additional feature compared to the original program: the program can read, display, edit and write NHX files containing <tt>TID=&lt;string&gt;</tt> tags used for guided sequence placement with PAGAN. For any other purposes of tree display or editing you should use an up-to-date version of the original Archaeopteryx program. ArchaeopteryxPE is available as <a href="http://pagan-msa.googlecode.com/files/archaeopteryxPE.jar" rel="nofollow">Java jar-file</a> at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/downloads" rel="nofollow">download page</a> and can then be started with the command: </p><pre class="prettyprint">java -jar archaeopteryxPE.jar [reference.nhx]</pre><p>where the optional argument &#x27;reference.nhx&#x27; specifies a phylogeny file. (An example of a <a href="http://pagan-msa.googlecode.com/files/reference.nhx" rel="nofollow">valid tree file</a> is available at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/downloads" rel="nofollow">download page</a>.)

This is provided to comply with the GPL and is not needed by a typical user. </p><p>The tree in the example file provided contains two types of NHX tags, <tt>D=Y</tt> and <tt>TID=0[12]</tt>. The red dots indicate duplication nodes (<tt>D=Y</tt>) and yellow dots the PAGAN target nodes (<tt>TID=01</tt> or <tt>TID=02</tt>). If a yellow node is clicked, a panel with the node data, including the PAGAN TID, is opened. To edit an existing TID tag or add a new tag at another node, the node has to be right-clicked and then &quot;Edit Node Data&quot; selected (or &quot;Edit Node Data&quot; selected at the &quot;Click on Node to:&quot; drop-down menu on the left and then the node clicked). This will open an edit panel with the PAGAN TID field in the bottom. The text-insert mode can be activated by clicking (repeatedly) the text field on the right side of the page icon. When saving the tree file, the NHX format can be selected from the file format drop-down menu. </p><p><br> </p><h2><a name="Examples_of_guided_placement"></a>Examples of guided placement<a href="#Examples_of_guided_placement" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>The PAGAN download files contain example datasets for guided placement of protein sequences (full length and fragments) and NGS reads. The datasets can found in directories <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/source/browse/#git%2Fexamples%2Fprotein_placement" rel="nofollow">`examples/protein_placement`</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/source/browse/#git%2Fexamples%2Fngs_placement" rel="nofollow">`examples/ngs_placement`</a>. </p><p>The idea of guided placement is to extend existing alignments with new sequences for which the (rough) phylogenetic location is known. The situation may be complicated by paralogous genes and uncertainty of the right target for the new sequences. For such cases, PAGAN allows indicating several potential targets and then chooses the best location by aligning the query sequences to each specified target. </p><p>The examples are based on simulated data. In these examples, we have reference alignments that include gene sequences from several mammals; the hypothetical gene has duplicated first in the ancestor of primates and rodents and then again in the ancestor of rodents. Our new sequences come from a primitive primate, believed to belong phylogenetically between tarsier and lemur, and a rodent, belonging between guinea pig and ground squirrel. Because of the gene duplications, the primate and rodent sequences have two and three potential target locations, respectively, in the phylogeny. These are indicated in the reference phylogenies using special TID tags. The phylogenies and the target locations for guided placement can be viewed and edited with the <a href="http://pagan-msa.googlecode.com/files/archaeopteryxPE.jar" rel="nofollow">ArchaeopteryxPE software</a> available on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/downloads" rel="nofollow">PAGAN download site</a>. ArchaeopteryxPE indicates the duplication nodes with red dots and the TID target nodes with yellow dots and the guide phylogeny looks like this: </p><p><img src="images/guide_tree.png" width="600px"> </p><p>When sequences are placed with PAGAN, it first tries placing each query sequence to every matching target node and chooses the best node. If several target nodes score equally well, the sequence is assigned to each one of them. PAGAN then starts aligning the sequences to targets, adding several query sequences to the same target using a progressive approach. The complete new subtree is then inserted back to the reference alignment, adding space for the new insertions if necessary. Importantly, the relative alignment of existing reference sequences is not changed.  </p><p>The examples demonstrate that the selection of the target node for each query sequence is not straightforward. Long sequences are placed correctly but shorter ones may be placed to a wrong node. Errors are also more likely between closely-related paralogs than between distant ones. </p><p><br> </p><h3><a name="Example_of_guided_placement_of_protein_sequences"></a>Example of guided placement of protein sequences<a href="#Example_of_guided_placement_of_protein_sequences" class="section_anchor"></a></h3><p>The following files are included in directory <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/source/browse/#git%2Fexamples%2Fprotein_placement" rel="nofollow">`examples/protein_placement`</a>:  </p><ul><li><tt>reference_aa.fas</tt>   : simulated reference alignment. </li><li><tt>reference_tree.nhx</tt> : reference phylogeny with some nodes tagged for placement. </li><li><tt>input_aa_full.fas</tt>  : simulated amino-acid sequences. </li><li><tt>input_aa_frags.fas</tt> : a subset of the one above, broken into fragments. </li></ul><p>The data can be analysed using the following commands: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pagan --ref-seqfile reference_aa.fas --ref-treefile reference_tree.nhx \

This can be overridden with options <tt>--test-every-internal-node</tt> and <tt>--test-every-node</tt> that exhaustively search through either internal nodes or all nodes (including leaf nodes) and add the sequence at the node where it matches the best. This allows using PAGAN for metagenomic analyses of sequences of unknown origin.  </p><p>Exhaustive search using PAGAN&#x27;s exact alignment can be very slow. To speed up the search of the optimal placement node, PAGAN can use Guy Slater&#x27;s <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate" rel="nofollow">Exonerate</a>; Exonerate is not provided by the PAGAN package and has to be installed separately and be on the system&#x27;s execution path ($PATH).

With this option, PAGAN runs Exonerate local alignment against the chosen nodes (all/all internal/all tagged) and keep the best of them; it would then run Exonerate gapped alignment against those nodes and choose the best for the placement. </p><p>With other options, one can choose to perform just a local or gapped alignment with Exonerate, and change the number of nodes kept after each round. The number of nodes kept is based either on the score relative to the best score, or a fixed number of best-ranking nodes. If more than one node is returned by Exonerate, PAGAN will perform alignments against those and choose the best scoring one for the placement. </p><p><br> </p><h3><a name="Example_of_unguided_placement_of_NGS_reads"></a>Example of unguided placement of NGS reads<a href="#Example_of_unguided_placement_of_NGS_reads" class="section_anchor"></a></h3><p>The following files are included in directory <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/source/browse/#git%2Fexamples%2Fngs_placement" rel="nofollow">`examples/ngs_placement`</a>: </p><ul><li><tt>reference_codon.fas</tt> : simulated reference alignment. </li><li><tt>reference_tree.nhx</tt>  : reference phylogeny (with some nodes tagged for placement). </li><li><tt>input_ngs.fastq</tt>     : simulated Illumina reads. </li><li><tt>input_ngs_primates.fastq</tt> : a subset of the one above. </li></ul><p>These files are primarily meant to demonstrate <strong>guided</strong> placement but can equally well be used for <strong>unguided</strong> placement. As the unguided placement can be very slow, we use here the Exonerate speed-up and assume that the Exonerate software is installed on the system as explained above. The PAGAN placement of query sequences is approximate and is only performed to allow for the accurate alignment of the data (e.g. for downstream analyses to build longer contigs of the overlapping sequences). If the aim is to infer the phylogenetic origin of the query sequences, one should re-analyse the alignments with an appropriate program.   </p><p>If one wants to use the speed-ups for the placement search but restrict the placement to the tagged nodes, the data can be analysed using the following command: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pagan --ref-seqfile reference_codon.fas --ref-treefile reference_tree.nhx \

--test-every-node</pre><p>As could be guessed, the first command only considers placement at the internal nodes of the reference phylogeny (<tt>--test-every-internal-node</tt>) whereas the second one considers all nodes (<tt>--test-every-node</tt>) and can place the reads also at the tip/leaf nodes.  </p><p>PAGAN makes the alignment in two phases: it first finds the best phylogenetic location for each read and, once that is finished, it then aligns the reads to the locations chosen. The progressive approach of the latter allows correctly taking into account the insertions shared by the query reads and not present in the reference alignment. PAGAN aligns and outputs full sequences but it may sometimes discard complete reads if no good placement is found (by Exonerate) or the resulting alignments (by PAGAN) looks poor. A placement for some reads discarded by Exonerate may be found with PAGAN&#x27;s exhaustive search that is selected with option <tt>--exhaustive-placement</tt>; the threshold for the read rejection at the later stages can be adjusted with options <tt>--overlap-minimum</tt>, <tt>--overlap-identity</tt> and <tt>--overlap-identical-minimum</tt>. See <tt>pagan --help</tt> for the default values.  </p><p>Although poorly matching reads may be discarded, PAGAN does not otherwise delete sites of the query reads. If the FASTQ trimming is used, low-quality reads may be truncated from the ends.  </p><p>One should also note that PAGAN can place one query sequence to multiple locations if they score equally well. This makes sense in some analyses but may cause problems in others. This behaviour can be disabled with option <tt>--one-placement-only</tt>.

Typically, the placement is performed one query at time and requires writing files for the query sequence and for the target sequences; this is repeated twice, first with a rough and then with a more thorough alignment. For a large number of queries, this requires lots reading and writing and there is also significant overhead in launching Exonerate multiple times. </p><p>PAGAN now includes an experimental feature to quickly assign queries to targets using approximate ungapped alignments only. In practice,  the analysis starts with the placement of all queries and Exonerate is run only once (albeit this can be a relatively long run).

In NGS read placement, the overlapping regions of reads placed to a specific target node are expected to be identical and any differences observed are (with the exception heterozygosity that we ignore) some sort of errors. For the placement of DNA sequences, PAGAN offers an alternative approach to reconstruct ancestor graphs based on majority consensus. This is selected with option <tt>--use-consensus</tt>. </p><p>Using a similar majority consensus approach, PAGAN can combine reads placed to a specific target into longer contigs. This is done with option <tt>--build-contigs</tt>; the minimum number of reads supporting a site in the contig can be changed with option <tt>--consensus-minimum</tt>. The contigs, with the reads supporting them, are written to a file named <tt>*_contigs.fas</tt>. </p><p>By default, the disconnected contigs are bridged with <tt>n</tt>&#x27;s, estimating the size of the contig gap from the outgroup ancestral sequence.

The effect of trimming is obvious from the output; the bases written in lower case in the output were masked and considered as N&#x27;s during the alignment.

This is not recommended for distantly-related sequences but can be useful for highly similar sequences that require alignment. This may be relevant e.g. in the analysis of overlapping noisy reads from the same locus; if the reads have been generated on Roche 454 or Ion Torrent platform, PAGAN&#x27;s ability to model the homopolymer errors is especially useful. </p><p>Like in any alignment also in a pileup alignment the consenus sequence (the alignment of sequences included so far) and the next sequence to be added should overlap. PAGAN can include sequences that do not overlap but the region in between has to be bridged by other sequences and thus the order of adding the sequences can be important. If the sequences are from the same species, the option to reconstruct the consensus sequence can also be useful. </p><p>The pileup alignment is done by selecting option <tt>--pileup-alignment</tt> and defining the input file with <tt>--queryfile query_sequence_file</tt>.  Typically one would also add option <tt>--use-consensus</tt> to specify that the character states are based on consensus, not the last-added and possibly incorrect sequence (e.g. due to contamination of the data), and to output the final consensus sequence.

Config files can, of course, be written or extended manually using the same format. One should note, however, that also boolean options need a value assigned, such as <tt>trim-read-ends = 1</tt> in the example above. If a boolean option is not wanted, it should not specified in the config file (or it should be commented out with a hash sign) as setting an option e.g. <tt>0</tt> or <tt>false</tt> does not disable it. </p><p>Options in a config file are overridden by re-defining them on command line. Thus, the command: </p><pre class="prettyprint">./pagan config.cfg --outfile another_name</pre><p>is the same as the one above except that the results will be placed to a file with another name. </p><p><br> </p><p><a href="#Using_PAGAN">back to top</a> </p>
